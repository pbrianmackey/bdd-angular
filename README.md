# About

Template project for using Cucumber-js in Angular.  Cucumber is a library for running BDD tests in Angular.

I believe BDD is one of the most effective ways to ease communication between business and development.  The Gherkin syntax is simple.  You have a "Scenario" that uses the language "Given, When, Then" to describe a single requirement.  For example:

```
Given I have a website  
When I try to access the website  
Then a login will request me to authenticate myself
```

I include .vscode/launch.json as an example of how to modify this file so that you can debug individual tests.
