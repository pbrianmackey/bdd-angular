# About

Template project for using Cucumber-js in Angular.  Cucumber is a library for running BDD tests in Angular.

I believe BDD is one of the most effective ways to ease communication between business and development.  The syntax is very simple.  You have "Scenarios" that use the language "Given, When, Then" for example:

Given I have a website
When I try to access the website
Then a login will request me to authenticate myself
